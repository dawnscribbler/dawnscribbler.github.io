[Saturday after Ash Wednesday](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/daily-readings/2020-02-29)

```
Is 58:9b-14
Ps 86:1-2, 3-4, 5-6
Lk 5:27-32
```
There are things that God wants; things He desires from us. He gives us things out of compassion for us and He desires that we also do things to others out of compassion. Rather than only spending time with God when there are things that we need, He desires that we spend time with Him to learn more about Him. 

God's greatest desire is to give us good things. There is a side of us that only wants to receive; receiving without giving. If left unchecked, we become hoarders - materially and spiritually. We need to practice doing things to and for others without them needing to ask us, and only for their own good. If we cannot do them ourselves, we must create the way for God to work.

God controls everything. Whatever we need, God will give us. Whatever we have been given is not ours; we must thank God for the gift and then proceed to use it for the good of others. 

_Turn your ear, O LORD, and answer me,  
for I am poor and needy.  
Preserve my soul, for I am faithul;  
save the servant who trusts in you, my God_
