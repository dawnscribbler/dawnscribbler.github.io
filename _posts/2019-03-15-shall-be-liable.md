Ez. 18:12-28
Ps 130:1-8
Mt 5:20-26

We are creatures of Passion and we don’t worry about it as much as we should because a few of the times, it leads us to do good things, especially good things for God. But, we should worry about it because passion is an untamed force, like a wildfire, which easily gets out of our control when given free rein. More often than not, it leads us away from the right path and we find out that we are not in control of it after it has caused catastrophic damage. What makes things worse is that when we realise the damage it has done, we are still reluctant to take the blame because it doesn’t feel like our doing; it feels like someone else was acting in us or as us. Today, we are warned that we are culpable and liable for every single action and we will bear their consequences. 

To let us understand how severe this warning is, the First Reading says to the righteous man who turns to wickedness “None of the righteous deeds which he has done shall be remembered” and to the wicked man who turns to righteousness, “None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him”. This certainly seems like the righteous man has the worse end of the deal. NONE of His deeds will be remembered?! None? We normally weigh the punishment for a first-time offender less than a repeat offender because we argue that it was a mistake that will not be repeated. However, this is actually a sign that the righteous man has lost whatever control he might have had, because before getting to this point, turmoil had been brewing in his heart for a while. Which is why the Gospel warns us not to wait until something catastrophic happens before we know we are bad – waiting means the passion has taken root and embedded itself deep in our soul. Rather, we are to nip it before it thinks of budding.

“Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” The Pharisees and Scribes worked to ensure that the parts of their character on display were free of fault because they were only worried about the opinion of the people. We must go beyond that to worry about the opinion of God by ensuring that even areas that are hidden from human view are also spotless. We cannot avoid the blame for our actions if at the end of the day, they lead us away from God. COnversely, if we are able to curtail our raging passions and steer ourselves right, then all our misdeeds will be forgotten; it will be as if we never committed them.

This is a daunting task; once passion has taken root, human intervention is impossible. And so, the Responsorial Psalm begs God to have mercy on our weakness, “If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? But with you is found forgiveness, that you may be revered.” But this is not the end of it, the forgiveness granted to us is the chance to make a change; the forgiveness of God is the beginning of a new journey; the journey which begins with, in the words of the Gospel Acclamation (Ez. 18:31), “Cast away from you all transgressions which you have committed...”, and continues on to “get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit”. This means that we need a new rule of life; we can no longer allow ourselves to be ruled by passion because we cannot afford to be handed “over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be out in prison; truly, I say to you, you will not get out till you have paid the last penny”.
