```
Dan. 9: 4-10
Ps 79: 8, 9, 11, 13 (R. Ps 103:10)
Lk 6:36-38 
```

Desiring true and lasting repentance means that we need to have a soft landing in place. This is because if we come face-to-face with our guilt without it, we are most likely to get into worse shape than before; we will hit the ground so hard and become deformed and/or disfigured. This soft landing is the assurance of God’s tender mercy and forgiveness. 

In the First reading, the Prophet Daniel has come to terms with the fact that they “have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from (God’s) commandments and ordinances, and …have not listened to the prophets”. This is quite an admission of guilt to which he adds, “To you, Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us, confusion of face”. There is great shame in finding out and dealing with guilt and it can keep us looped in a never-ending replay of our past sins and mistakes.  

The assurance of God mercy is given to us in the Gospel, “Be merciful even as your Father is merciful”. The word to note in this line is the “even”. That line tells us that God’s mercy is so boundless that we can only hope to imitate even little bit of it. This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try, but that we, first, need to get a clear idea of the extent of God compassion to us when we sin against Him; He does not judge us, neither does He condemn us, but He forgives us. 

It is possible that we come to the full knowledge of God’s mercy by attempting to practice it ourselves. As boundless as the mercy of God is, it seems we cannot experience it in its entirety unless we attempt to do the same, because we are told, “…good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be put in your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.” If this is so, then maybe it is no wonder that we confess our sins and we don’t experience that feeling of forgiveness; we need our measure readjusted.

“Your words Lord are Spirit and Life; you have the words of eternal life”  (Jn 6:63.68) We are invited to echo the words of the Psalmist today, “Do not remember against us, the guilt of former times. Let your compassion hasten to meet us, for we have been brought very low”.
