Everything else is spectacular about Jesus' prediction of His death apart from the part of Him dying. It is cool that He knows how, when and where, but the fact that He will die shouldn't have come as a surprise. In this part of the Gospel, there is a lot of tension; challenges are being tossed back and forth between warring parties - the head is at war with the heart and it must go, no matter that without the heart, the head is nothing.
