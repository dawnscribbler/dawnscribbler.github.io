We are used to seeking out righteousness, that is, looking for things to do that will please God and enable us to find favour with Him. But when God makes promises and decides to give gifts, this is when righteousness comes seeking us. The only requirement for the fulfilment of the promises and reception of these gifts is faith – “hoping against hope” – believing what we’ve been told. The child who will “save His people from their sins”, comes from a long line of people who were reckoned as righteous for their faith in God.  

When Prophet Nathan brought the news to King David of God’s plan, King David believed. How do we know this? Because, David started praising God as if God had already fulfilled his promise. He didn’t ask, where, when, how, why, he simply praised God because God had said it. “The promises of the LORD I will sing forever; through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness, for you have said, ‘My kindness is established forever’; in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness”. 

This is a radical type of faith where we don’t see anything or get anything to assure that there is actually a covenant and/or that the promise will be kept. This is the type of faith that Abraham had in God and it precedes King David’s. Which is why Abraham is the father of all of us, because he gives us the prototype of a proper relationship with God. “Blessed are those who dwell in your house, O Lord; they never cease to praise you.” 

This radical faith is also why the law is limited in its ability to allow the promise of God to reach all the peoples of the world, “it depends on faith, so that it may be a gift, and the promise may be guaranteed to all his descendants”. For the promise that God made to Abraham to reach the ends of the earth, we would have to believe, like Abraham, we will have to let go of everything we’ve ever known – everything we are used to – and open ourselves to strange and terrifying things; we will have to open our hearts to a God “who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not exist.”  

Saint Joseph was already a righteous man; his righteousness coming from being obedient to the Law and according to that law, he couldn’t be with a woman who was pregnant with another man’s child. But a new form of righteousness came seeking him out; he had to decide which was more important, the Law or the God of the Law, tangible or intangible, a way of life or a way to life. The choice to answer this call to righteousness wasn’t made easier because “the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream”. 

Sometimes, I think – I wish – that making decisions will be easier if I had a divine messenger telling me that this is the way I should go. But it doesn’t work that way. The work of making a choice still lies with us; the effort to yield our will over to God can never be bypassed. What helped Saint Joseph make the right choice was a willing heart; he already had a willing heart. A willing heart is one that is attuned to the will of God, and needs only a bit of prompting to yield to God. 

From the onset, Saint Joseph was “unwilling to expose her to shame”. Despite being conscious of the letter of the Law, he wasn’t following it dispassionately. He seemed to already know that the one who gave the Law was much greater than the Law itself, but he was afraid to act on his own whim. The conviction he had of Mary’s purity, despite the evidence, and the compassion he felt for the shame she would face when her condition became public knowledge were very strong combatants waging war in his soul; his heart was torn. And so, the coming of the angel was to set his heart at rest, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the Holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her.” 

And so, because of this act of faith by Saint Joseph – this act of righteousness – the promise from Abraham, “I have made you father of many nations” to David, “Your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before me” finds continuity until God’s plan of salvation comes to fruition, “he will save his people from their sins”.
