What is the utmost concern of God? To have a holy and righteous people faithful to Him, their God. Therefore, at the end of the day; at the end of all His convoluted planning, God wants hearts to be transformed and turned to Him. 

In the Gospel, Jesus tells the people in clear terms that the Kingdom will be taken away from them and given to a people who will be holy, righteous and faithful to their God; “The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.” Therefore, the story doesn’t end with the death of the son of the Vineyard owner, but with the vineyard being handed over “to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their season” And it wasn’t until the former tenants committed the ultimate act of murdering the son that the vineyard gets taken away from them. 

The Chief Priests and Pharisees were, therefore, suffering from faulty logic because they thought that getting rid of Jesus will nullify the prophesy. They didn’t listen to the parable properly or they will have been able to save themselves. Attempting to and even succeeding in getting rid of the irritating pest who prophesies unfavourably doesn’t get rid of the prophesy. In fact, it seems to be the one thing that ensures that the prophesy will be fulfilled. 

This is shown clearly in the First Reading, where the brothers of Joseph said to themselves, “Here comes this dreamer. Come now, let us kill him... and we shall see what will become of his dreams.” The brothers of Joseph gave free rein to their jealously and maliciousness, all the while imagining that they were getting rid of an annoying pest – a dreamer who made unfavourable prophesies – never knowing that God was making judicious use of their emotions for His own glory.

Joseph could have easily been kidnapped on his way to Shechem or Dothan by the Ishmaelites and taken to Egypt, but, by being deliberately sold by the people whom, by the request of his father, he came to refresh and nourish – the very people who bow to him in his dream – it loses merit as simply an unfortunate situation. “When he summoned a famine on the land, and broke every staff of bread, he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave” He was not “captured” but “sold” as a slave. The people whom he belonged to gave him up, but God was with him, and “until what he had said came to pass the word of the LORD tested him”

This is the salvation that we have been granted, that we have now been given the Kingdom of God through the death of the Son of God; we are the stones rejected by the builders which have now become the cornerstone.  It is the Lord’s doing, “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” It is marvellous in our eyes.
