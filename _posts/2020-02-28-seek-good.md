[Friday after Ash Wednesday](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/daily-readings/2020-02-28)

```
Is 58:1-9a
Ps 51:3-4, 5-6ab, 18-19
Mt 9:14-15
```

When serving God, we want to do it our way. We want to feel like we owe God something. But there is only one way and that is to follow His law of love. 

Injuring ourselves will not make God listen to us faster. It serves no purpose in gaining God's attention unless it is paired with righteousness. If it will be useful, it will be that the motivation is not to gain God's attention but to dispose ourselves correctly. 

What do you hope to gain when you fast?

_My sacrifice to God, a broken spirit:  
A broken and humble heart,   
O God, you will not spurn._
