[Saturday of the First Week of Lent](https://www.ewtn.com/daily-readings/?date=2019-03-16)

```
Deuteronomy 26:16-19
Psalms 119:1-2, 4-5, 7-8
Matthew 5:43-48
```
When I hear the words, “the Lord your God commands you”, or the words, “You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect”, I feel trepidation in my heart, my head rebels at the implied obligation and I start grumbling about the lack of freedom when it comes to dealing with God. Because of this, I get bent out of shape scrutinizing phrases and looking for loopholes to get me out of obeying the edicts of God as carefully, “with all my heart and soul”, as I should. 

There is a lot of hard work involved in obeying God, and the summary of that hard work is the renunciation of the will. But this attitude of mine clearly signals one thing that I continually forget, “You have declared this day concerning the LORD that he is your God”. The only reason God is “commanding” me to do anything is because I agreed to it. I declared that I want Him for my God, and in agreement, He declared I am His because I obey His word. 

Rather than becoming passive aggressive or looking for loopholes, and to be clear this attitude deceives no one but myself, I see that it is a time to re-evaluate my status as “a people for His own possession”. This means that I have to check if I am one of the Blessed, “Blessed are those whose way is blameless… Blessed are those who keep his decrees…” And I am encouraged by the Gospel Acclamation to do this re-evaluation now. “Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.”

Keeping the commandments of the Lord will ensure that I become, “a people holy to the LORD your God, as he has spoken”, but Jesus goes a step further and calls me to perfection, “what more are you doing than others?” This perfection raises my status from “a people holy to the LORD your God” to “sons of your Father who is in heaven”. This perfection prevents me from simply following the letter of the law, to following the spirit of the law which is, and has always been, Love.

It is quite interesting that when I complain about something being hard, then I hear something even harder which supersedes and nullifies the hard one. But in either case, I am not compelled to any action, it is always a choice. Every choice that is to be made requires careful reflection. Every choice is a chance to learn and grow. “O that my ways may be steadfast in keeping thy statutes! I will praise thee with an upright heart, when I learn thy righteous ordinances. I will observe thy statutes; O forsake me not utterly!”
