We are aware that prayer creates a channel of communication between we and God, but we are not always aware of its effects on our mental and psychological well-being possibly because we have limited God to be a physical-and-tangible-needs provider that we don't realise that there are other dimensions to His provision abilities. It could also be because we are always so focused on the physical outcomes, that we vet our list to include only certain things and leave the rest up to ourselves and the power of our strategy. Today, we are asked to submit our entire Wishlist, and most importantly ourselves –mind, heart, soul, and will – to God. 

"Esther the Queen, seized with deathly anxiety, fled to the Lord," and so, it is not surprising that she had a long list of requests. In reading her entire prayer, she begins it by saying, "... help me, who am alone and have no helper but you", she repeats this line in verse 14, and ends the prayer with, "And save me from my fear!" It seems like amidst the things she had to do and wanted God to do for her, she was able to identify the thing that mattered the most, psychological well-being. Here is a woman who is hailed as being heroic and courageous acknowledging that she is weak and helpless with no hope and paralysed with fear. 

In this day and age, if we happen to find ourselves “seized with deathly anxiety”, or any other equally lethal emotion, it is most probable that we'd, instead, try various other methods to calm ourselves down. And if those don’t work, then we’d start cataloguing our advantages to see where we can hope to succeed in the situation of which we are anxious about or look for where to cut our losses. If we were Esther, the Queen, we’d lean heavily on our beauty, status as Queen and the fact that the King has a special preference us.  Notice she never mentioned any of these attributes in her prayer, and where she alludes to them, not as advantages but as abhorrent to her. If she had depended on them, she most likely won't have made history as a heroic Queen or any thing else. 

Jesus wants us to ask, seek, and knock in the same way as Queen Esther; He wants us entirely reliant and dependent on God. In every need, want and desire, Jesus wants our first point of call to be our heavenly Father because he assures us that with God, we are getting the best treatment possible “...how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!”. Depending on God for everything also means that we depend on Him to decide what, how and when we should get it. Depending on God means surrendering ourselves and allowing Him to run the show – even when He makes a detour in the plans. 

We are often hampered from utter dependence on God because of our attachment to outcomes and our need to control situations. The Gospel Acclamation helps us to pray for the ability to let go of them. “Create in me a clean heart, O God; restore to me the joy of your salvation.” If we are fully dependent on God, our joy will be full when He answers us in the way that pleases Him. There will be no dissatisfaction, no second-guessing, no delays in going back to Him to make new requests; we will echo the words of the Responsorial Psalm "On the day I called, you answered me; you increased the strength of my soul...With your right hand you save me".
