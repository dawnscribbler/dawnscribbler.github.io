Today’s readings are all-round depressing. It makes me so miserable to think that I am on the side of the cursed, the wicked or the Rich Man. And even if I said I was going to scrupulously search my heart, and try to discern it, again, it seems I am out of luck, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can understand it?” Furthermore, it seems like it is not so much our actions that condemn us but the sources from which they originate from, “I the LORD search the mind and try the heart…” 

If I think I am doing good, but my motivations are evil, then I am not doing good. If I am doing evil, but my motivations are good, I am still not doing good. For my actions can be considered good, I have to do good which must be motivated by good. A lot of times, I think that I can smother away bad intentions by good deeds; I can deceive myself to eternity this way, but there is no deceiving God, “for the LORD knows the way of the just, but the way of the wicked will perish.”

In the Gospel, it is interesting that the rich man recognized Lazarus and knew him by name. This suggests that the rich man wasn’t oblivious to his surroundings. Could his heart, then, have been deceiving him all his lifetime that it was until he was in torment before he woke up to the reality of his situation; that he should have offered comfort? In his torment, he articulated what he should have done for Lazarus in his lifetime. Next, he tries to save his brothers, probably in an attempt to make things right. In both situations, he wants Lazarus to do things for him, and yet he wasn’t inclined to do anything for Lazarus while they were both on earth. 

It is equally interesting that during his life and in the next life, Lazarus speaks nary a word. Could it be because he is like the tree planted by water that “is not anxious in the year of drought”? This will be very ironic because I am not expecting that tree to be covered in sores and have dogs licking away at its sores. However, it seems that even in his desire to be fed from the rich man’s table, his heart was in the right place, and the reward he received at the end of his life shows that he did, indeed, trust in the Lord. 

Given that it is difficult to discern the fathomless depths of our hearts, and it is possible to perform good and righteous-looking deeds even without a matching interior, it seems that the key to unlocking the secrets of the heart is to “hear Moses and the prophets” (Luke 16:31) and watch the “fruit of our doings” (Jer. 17:10). To hear and to believe the word of God reaches far down into the depth of our heart to effect the changes necessary that will show, not in our actions, but in the fruit of our actions. “Blessed are those, who hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with patience” (Luke 8:15).

In addition to the above, and to avoid ending up like the rich man, maybe we shouldn’t be so averse to torments and afflictions. Because they wake us up more thoroughly than any cold water or any well-written, heart-rending sermon can. It was in torment that the rich man realised where his eyes should have been, “being in torment, he lifted up his eyes”. Instinctively and without thought, he looked up to find consolation; he looked up to find God. It is possible that, if Lazarus’ desire had been fulfilled, his heart could have turned away from God (Jer. 17:5) and he would have become cursed. “Blessed is the man who has placed his trust in the Lord.”
