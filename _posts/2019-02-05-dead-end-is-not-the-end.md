DEAD END IS NOT THE END

The readings today speak of how things can never so bad that there is no hope for us if we but know where exactly to place our hope. The burden of living is tiresome and hectic; there always seems to be something to deal with. It&#39;s either something new and unpredictable happens which seems to foil our carefully laid-out plans or it&#39;s one of the many old situations that we have not found resolutions to and which remain as thorns in the side.

The Gospel is a two-for-the-price-of-one story. At first sight, they seem to be different and independent stories; one of a courageous woman who reached out and snatched her miracle, and another of a powerful man who humbled himself and asked for a miracle. But, apart from the fact that the woman had been suffering from the flow of blood for as long as the girl had been alive – twelve years, there are two other things to note. The first is that they have one common theme running through, and that is that both the woman and the man are dealing with dead ends.

The woman has been living for twelve years with haemorrhage and _&quot;__had … spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.&quot;  (__Mark 5:25-26)_. She is the classic case of the person dealing with an old situation that hadn&#39;t been resolved and had no possibility of being resolved by any human means; the more she did, the worse things were getting.  I would think she should have just given up and gone on quietly with her life not even daring to hope in anything anymore, which is why it&#39;s amazing that she was out about in a crowded place. Shouldn&#39;t she have stayed out of sight and out of mind, skulking in dark and lonely places? And yet, if she stayed home and skulked, would she had heard about Jesus? Clearly, her hope was still alive, only that she need to put it in the right place. After twelve long years, she finally placed here hope in the right place and was rewarded instantly. _&quot; __And_ **immediately** _the haemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease__&quot;__(__Mark 5:29)_.

The man, Ja&#39;irus, is the classic case of one who has to adapt himself to changing situations. He thought his work was already done by calling Jesus to save his daughter, and certainly, it takes a lot of strength of character to fall at the feet of Jesus as this man was in a powerful position – a ruler of the synagogue. But it seems he was to be tested even further, he came for a healing and before that can happen, death comes along: _&quot;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&quot; (__Mark 5:35)_ This is a major shift in plan! Who knows how long it took him to work up his faith to the point that he can believe enough to ask Jesus for a cure, and now what is he to do? Clearly, he has to recalibrate that faith and boost it so as to be able to ask for the impossible, but could he? Would he? He wouldn&#39;t have been able to if Jesus didn&#39;t suggest that even at this point, it wasn&#39;t the end because what follows is: _&quot;__But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, &quot;Do not fear; only believe.&quot;_ _(__Mark 5:35)_.

This, therefore, bring us to the second point to note about two seemingly different and independent stories which may not necessarily be so. This point is that the miracle of the woman with the flow of blood was necessary to boost the faith of Ja&#39;irus. And I say this because Jesus didn&#39;t have to call attention to the woman; she was already healed. She knew that. Jesus knew that. Maybe an affirmation of the woman&#39;s courage was necessary so that she had no doubts about her miracle, but it didn&#39;t need to be so public. Jesus is normally humble and tells people not to speak about the fact that He healed them but they normally disobey which in turn causes problems for Him later on, but yet here He is shouting in a crowd_, &quot;who touched my garments?!!!&quot;_ And yet how else would Ja&#39;irus have been able to keep faith in Jesus _(__Mark 5:35)_ even after news of death had reached them?

Ja&#39;irus had asked Jesus to, _&quot; __Come and lay your hands on her&quot;__ (__Mark 5:23)_ and now he got a chance to witness something much greater than his own request. He witnessed a healing just by the touch of… Jesus&#39; garments! A miracle was performed independent of Jesus&#39; physical body parts or consciousness; power left Him through an item of clothing simply because of great faith in Him: _&quot;__Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him&quot;_ _(__Mark 5:30)_. It is also very comical that there is a role reversal between Jesus and His disciples in that they are the ones now pointing out how absurd Jesus sounds: &quot;You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, `Who touched me?&#39;&quot;(Mark 5:35). I can almost see them rolling their eyes, but clearly, not only Ja&#39;irus needed a lesson in the mysterious workings of God because Ja&#39;irus too were rewarded instantly: _&quot;__And_ **immediately** _the girl got up and walked (she was twelve years of age)&quot; (__Mark 5:42)._

Adding Jesus to mix makes things change immediately.  Which is why Saint Paul urges us in the first reading_, &quot;Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.&quot; (Hebrews 12:3)_. Consider Him. Consider Jesus. Anytime things seem crazy. Anytime things seem like loose ends, dead ends.... Anytime. Every time. So that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. For the Ruler of the Synagogue, the haemorrhaging woman was his faith booster. In our case, we have not only one woman but multitudes which serve as our faith booster: _&quot;…__we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses&quot;_ _(Hebrews 12:1)_ so that we keep, _&quot;__looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith&quot;_ _(Hebrews 12:2)._ Nothing is bad that can&#39;t be reversed. No matter what. No matter for how long. No matter our capabilities or incapabilities of adapting to change. Because God, in the words of the Psalmist has promised us, _&quot;__those who seek him shall praise the LORD!&quot; (__Psalms 22:25)_

_&quot;G__o in peace, and be healed of your disease…_ _The child is not dead but sleeping… &quot;._ If our lives – our circumstances – have not ended in Jesus, then it is not the end.
