The readings today speak of how things can never so bad that there is no hope
for us if we but know where exactly to place our hope. The burden of living is
tiresome and hectic; there always seems to be something to deal with. It’s
either something new and unpredictable happens which seems to foil our carefully
laid-out plans or it’s one of the many old situations that we have not found
resolutions to and which remain as thorns in the side.

The Gospel is a two-for-the-price-of-one story. At first sight, they seem to be
different and independent stories; one of a courageous woman who reached out and
snatched her miracle, and another of a powerful man who humbled himself and
asked for a miracle. But, apart from the fact that the woman had been suffering
from the flow of blood for as long as the girl had been alive – twelve years,
there are two other things to note. The first is that they have one common theme
running through, and that is that both the woman and the man are dealing with
dead ends.

The woman has been living for twelve years with haemorrhage and *“had spent
all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.” (Mark 5:25-26)*. She
is the classic case of the person dealing with an old situation that hadn’t been
resolved and had no possibility of being resolved by any human means; the more
she did, the worse things were getting. I would think she should have just given
up and gone on quietly with her life not even daring to hope in anything
anymore, which is why it’s amazing that she was out about in a crowded place.
Shouldn’t she have stayed out of sight and out of mind, skulking in dark and
lonely places? And yet, if she stayed home and skulked, would she had heard
about Jesus? Clearly, her hope was still alive, only that she needed to put it in
the right place. *“She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment”(Mark 5:25-27)*. And after twelve long years, she finally placed here hope in the
right place and was rewarded instantly. *“And immediately the haemorrhage
ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease” (Mark
5:29)*.

The man, Ja’irus, is the classic case of one who has to adapt himself to
changing situations. He thought his work was already done by calling Jesus to
save his daughter, and certainly, it takes a lot of strength of character to
fall at the feet of Jesus as this man was in a powerful position – a ruler of
the synagogue. But it seems he was to be tested even further; he came for a
healing and before that happened, death came along: *"Your daughter is dead.
Why trouble the Teacher any further?" (Mark 5:35)* This is a major shift in
plan! Who knows how long it took him to work up his faith to the point that he
could believe enough to ask Jesus for a cure, and now what was he to do? Give up? Clearly,
he had to recalibrate that faith and boost it so as to be able to ask for the
impossible, but could he? Would he? He wouldn’t have been able to if Jesus
hadn’t suggested that even at that point, it wasn’t the end:*“But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Do not fear; only believe." (Mark 5:35)*.

This, therefore, bring us to the second point to note about two seemingly
different and independent stories which may not necessarily be so. This point is
that the miracle of the woman with the flow of blood was necessary to boost the
faith of Ja’irus. And I say this because Jesus didn’t have to call attention to
the woman; she was already healed. She knew that. Jesus knew that. Maybe an
affirmation of the woman’s courage was necessary so that she had no doubts about
her miracle, but it didn’t need to be so public. Jesus is normally humble and
tells people not to speak about the fact that He healed them but they normally
disobey which in turn causes problems for Him later on. In fact, after the healing of Ja’irus' daugter, Jesus *“strictly charged them that no one should know this" (Mark 5:43)*, but yet here He was
shouting in a crowd, *“who touched my garments?!!!”(Mark 5:30)* And yet how else would
Ja’irus have been able to keep faith in Jesus even after news of
death had reached them?

Ja’irus had asked Jesus to, *“Come and lay your hands on her” (Mark 5:23)* and
now he got a chance to witness something much greater than his own request. He
witnessed a healing just by the touch of… Jesus’ garments! A miracle was
performed independent of Jesus’ physical body parts or consciousness; power left
Him through an item of clothing simply because of great faith in Him: *“Jesus,
perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him” (Mark 5:30)*. It is
also very comical that there is a role reversal between Jesus and His disciples
in that they are the ones now pointing out how absurd Jesus sounds: "You see the
crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, \`Who touched me?'"(Mark 5:35). I
can almost see them rolling their eyes, but clearly, not only Ja’irus needed a
lesson in the mysterious workings of God because Ja’irus too were rewarded
instantly: *“And immediately the girl got up and walked (she was twelve years of
age)” (Mark 5:42).*

Adding Jesus to mix makes things change immediately. Which is why Saint Paul
urges us in the first reading*, “Consider him who endured from sinners such
hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.”
(Hebrews 12:3)*. Consider Him. Consider Jesus. Anytime things seem crazy.
Anytime things seem like loose ends, dead ends.... Anytime. Every time. So that
you may not grow weary or fainthearted. For the Ruler of the Synagogue, the
haemorrhaging woman was his faith booster. In our case, we have not only one
woman but multitudes which serve as our faith booster: *“…we are surrounded by
so great a cloud of witnesses” (Hebrews 12:1)* so that we keep, *“looking to
Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:2).* Nothing is bad
that can’t be reversed. No matter what. No matter for how long. No matter our
capabilities or incapabilities of adapting to change. Because God, in the words
of the Psalmist has promised us, *“those who seek him shall praise the LORD!”
(Psalms 22:25)*

*“Go in peace, and be healed of your disease… The child is not dead but
sleeping…”.* If our lives – our circumstances – have not ended in Jesus, then
it is not the end.
