The better question should have been, “Which is harder to accomplish?” and I think the answer is the forgiveness of sins because the people were right in their judgement, _“No one has the power to forgive sins but God.”_ The challenge was for them to realise that Jesus **is** God. It interesting, therefore, that Jesus reasoned that this was easier and used this route to heal the man by first saying, _“Child, your sins are forgiven”_. The question that bugs the mind is why. Does this mean that every other person Jesus healed wasn't forgiven? It seems that by taking the "easier" route, Jesus aimed to killed two birds with one stone.

Jesus was at home in Capernaum; He went back to the place where He was brought up. Everybody knew Him from childhood; they had watched Him grow and there had been nothing out of the ordinary about Him. Therefore, when news reached them of how extraordinary Jesus was; how He had been doing great things everywhere else, they gathered to see and hear for themselves. 
Therefore, the most urgent need in this situation was to declared His identity: “I am not who you think I am. You _**know**_ me, but you do not know _**me**_. I am not merely a Prophet, I am the one you’ve been waiting for. I am God.”

At that point in time, it was a huge concession for the people to acknowledge that Jesus was a man of God; they were still trying to judge the extent to which God was with Him; Prophet was still a stretch, and then He bombards them with a claim to be God? It is also interesting that Jesus doesn’t explicitly say that He is God (While on earth, and before His death, that equality with God is not brought to the forefront until Thomas says it explicitly after the resurrection), but instead He says, _“…the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”_

The words, _"Son of Man"_ and _"Authority"_ are disturbing because they still allude to the fact that He is of the same substance as God. This still made the people uneasy. But maybe this was Jesus' idea of going easy on them because if He said, explicitly, He was God , He might have had casualties. People, in those days, had a clearer picture of the might of God and so to claim to be God was not something you laugh over or ignore as annoying or uninteresting talk. But what strikes me is that Jesus specifically states His jurisdiction: _"on Earth"_. He has authority on earth to forgive sins. 

The second stone is that Jesus answered an unspoken, maybe even unknown, need of the paralysed man. The man and his friends had faith; great faith not only in the power of Jesus to heal but in the _abundance of His mercy_ that if they could get Jesus to see the man, Jesus will know what to do, without being asked. Maybe they had the insight that the paralysis wasn’t just physical? Maybe they didn’t? But it is certain that they were certain that Jesus knew what needed to be done, and that He would do it because they didn't say anything after letting the paralytic down and neither did the paralytic. Dangle the bait and see if it catches?

And they were right; their faith paid off. He did know and He removed both the spiritual and physical paralysis. All without either the paralysed man or his friends saying one word. All through all the ceremony of getting to Jesus, not one word he uttered; he just lay there, paralysed, but expectant and ready. And at the word of Jesus, he got up – no longer paralysed – and _“went out before them all”_.
