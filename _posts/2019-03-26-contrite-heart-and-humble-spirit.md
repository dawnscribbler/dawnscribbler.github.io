There might be difficulty forgiving other people, but it seems to me that there is an even bigger problem with being forgiven. People don’t take to being forgiven very well; it’s almost as if we wish we were not forgiven. This is what I think is wrong with the unforgiving servant. He couldn’t handle being forgiven; he hadn’t let go of his guilt and he acted towards another person the way he felt he should have been treated. 

However, it should be easier to be the person asking for forgiveness because one who is owed forgiveness. But the fact of the matter is that while waiting for forgiveness, one doesn’t usually think about one's own issues; guilt issues. If we don't realise that we have guilt issues to deal with, how can we hope to acclimatise to the feeling of being forgiven. And so the question becomes, how do we know that we am forgiven? 

It seems forgiveness has to have happened both ways – between the angered and the guilty – before the same can be extended to another person. The King forgave the servant, but, maybe, the servant needed to forgive the king too? Maybe he needed to forgive the king for owning so much property in the first place as this made him borrow too much that he couldn’t pay back or he needed to forgive the unequal situation of Master and Servant. Maybe. Maybe not. But clearly, the servant needed to forgive himself for the predicament he found himself. After all, there were witnesses to his shame and it so happens that these witnesses were the ones who reported back to the king. 

This is why it is interesting that Azariah “prayed aloud”, and in the fire, no less! Being in fire is enough of a pronouncement of shame and subjugation, did he still need to shout it out loud?  But this is the action of one whose heart is free from guilt and only waits, in sure hope, to be forgiven, “Good and upright is the LORD; thus he shows sinners the way”. Unlike the unforgiving servant, he is not begging for time to pay back, but is begging to be freed from debt. How shameless! And yet, what absolute trust! And as if he knows it, Azariah says, “...for those who trust in you cannot be put to shame.” 

Maybe the quality that needs to be present in us which both ensures that we forgive and assures us of being forgiven is a “contrite heart and humble spirit”. This quality, present in Azariah, is sorely lacking in the unforgiving servant. The moment we, somehow, believe that we can pay back or make restitution, by our own means, the debt that we owe to either God or man, then we can be certain that we are far away from forgiveness; we will continually feel guilty even if we have been genuinely forgiven and/or we will never be able to genuinely forgive another person. 

Today, we are called to a height of absolute low – utter shamelessness – in securing the mercy we desire from God. Only then can we begin to extend this merciful arm to our fellow brothers and sisters.  “Even now, says the LORD, return to me with your whole heart; for I am gracious and merciful.”
