Deuteronomy 30:15-20
Psalms 1:1-4, 6
Luke 9:22-25
```
It sounds like Moses is saying, "If you love God, you will keep His commandments, and His commandments are to love Him and one another". That sounds like a circular commandment - love begetting love.  

For the people in Jesus' time, they had seen His miracles, some of them had received healing themselves,but Jesus didn't count that as belief. Instead, if they really wanted to follow Him, they had to leave behind your own ideas of how to live and take on His own. 

There are times when we are set free from a very difficult situation we just rejoice to be out it. We don't think about how an impossible situation became possible and we don't consider God at all; somehow, the one who saves you doesn't really matter as long as you are saved. Even if someone is told us that what is happening is by the hand of God, we don't really believe it.

The choice of life or death is simple. If you can understand that being saved is the love of God, then you have chosen life because you are not going to want to do things that go against the one that loves you. If you cannot see the saving work of God in your life, then you have chosen death because there is no motivation to do whatever God has commanded. 

Acceptance is not verbal consent but action, and that action is to love actively.

_For the Lord knows the way of the just,  
but the way of the wicket will perish"_
