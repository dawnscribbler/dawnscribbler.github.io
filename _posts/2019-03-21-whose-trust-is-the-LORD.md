Where is your heart? Are you sure it is where you think it is? How can you be sure? “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can understand it?” This means that we can deceive ourselves to eternity – eternal damnation, to be precise – without realising it. This is because it is possible to do righteous-looking deeds without them profiting us for salvation.

That the rich man recognised and knew Lazarus by name suggests that they did meet during their lifetime. It is possible that he gave Lazarus a few scraps or threw him a few coins now and again. It is possible that this rich man was religious and unreproachable in abiding by the law of God because he referred to Abraham as “Father”. And, given that he lived sumptuously, he must have felt highly blessed and favoured by the Lord. It was, therefore, a rude wake-up call to find himself in Hades. 

We normally think that his crime was simply that he didn’t feed Lazarus in life, but his real crime goes deeper than that.; it is a case whereby even if he had done the right things, since those actions did not spring from the right intention, they wouldn’t profit him.  His crime starts with the fact that his trust wasn’t in God, but in himself and in man, “Cursed is the man who trusts in man, who makes flesh his arm, whose heart turns away from the Lord”. But how can we tell that this rich man was cursed? “There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously everyday”. 

It might seem absurd that the previous line testifies against him, after all, we are supposed to enjoy the fruits of our labour. Yet when he gets to Hades, he was looking for comfort not God. He didn’t ask for clarification on why he missed out on heaven, he didn’t show any remorse or penitence for whatever might have led him there; he just wanted comfort, “…cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this place”. 

Lazarus, on the other hand, wasn’t given comfort in heaven simply because he had been a poor man and full of sores. That is a pitiable state, but it doesn’t guarantee heaven to anybody, unless he is one of those “… whose trust is in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord.” How can we tell this of Lazarus? “And at his gates lay a poor man named Lazarus, full who desired to be fed from what fell from the rich man’s table; moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores”

More than the action of laying, allowing the dogs to lick at his sores shows his utter resignation; he bore his fate calmly. We can, therefore, compare him to the blessed who “walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers” because these three characters – the wicked, sinners and scoffers – are what fall off from the rich man’s table and if his desires were fulfilled, he wouldn’t have gained his future reward. 

At the end of the day, it seems that what can keep us from deceiving ourselves is torment or affliction, “being in torment, he lifted up his eyes…” These are things we so dearly love to avoid and which we can only accept kicking and screaming but there is no water as cold as torment or painful incomprehensible affliction to wake us up from our lukewarm-ness and complacency. But still, these will only work if we let them. 

Sometimes, afflictions can serve to drive us even farther away from God, which is why in addition, we need to “hear Moses and the prophets” (Luke 16:31) and watch the “fruit of our doings” (Jer. 17:10) because the Lord is not deceived by our self-deception, “I the LORD search the mind and try the heart…” To hear and to believe the word of God reaches far down into the depth of our heart to effect the necessary changes that will show, not in our actions, but in the fruit of our actions. “Blessed are those, who hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with patience” (Luke 8:15).
