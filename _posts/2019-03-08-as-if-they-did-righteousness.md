Mt 9:14-15

It is possible that we feel overburdened by the weight of the observances for Lent. This could be because we, like the people in the First Reading, feel like it serves no purpose as God doesn’t seem to be listening or acting in our favour. Even if we do manage to do something for Lent, our motivation might not be so pure either; it is possible that we do it so that we can use it as a bargaining chip for our later dealings with God.

There are some bad things we do because nobody “significant” is looking at us, and lots more we do because it feels like God is not looking at us. Even when we realise that we are wrong, we drag our feet to make amends because the consequences are not immediate. But God does see. And He says nothing. Unless He is asked.

It is when things don’t go our way, and we are in tight spots, that we begin to complain to God. And then we bring out our bargaining chip, “Why do we fast and you see it not? Why have we humbled ourselves and take no knowledge of it?”(Is. 58:3) Why do we not also say to God, “Why did we do bad things and you see it not? Great sins we commit, and you offer no retribution for them?” We want God to see our good, but we pay no mind to our bad. 

It is easy to interpret the First Reading as: doing good trumps external observances. And of course, this seems to make things easier as we can simply find a mindless activity that will satisfy the basic requirements of the Lenten observance. But I feel that the deeper message is that we need to examine our motivations for doing or not doing anything for God. 

When God answered the people’s complaint, He brought to light their selfishness. We seek good things from God, but we are not willing to do good to and for others. We claim to love the things of God and delight in Him, but only so long as this ensures that we keep getting good things from God. His response highlights two things: God wants to be loved for Himself and He wants whatever good gift He gives to us to be used for the benefit of others. He wants us to give to Him because of love of Him, and to ask and get things from Him because of love of neighbour.

In the Gospel, Jesus is also telling the disciples of John to check their motivation. “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?” The days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.” (Mt. 9:15). Jesus intimates that what we do in ‘the days that are coming’ will come from a deep place in our heart and not from outside. The fast that will occur in the absence of the bridegroom will not be because somebody told them to fast, but from sorrow and grief. 

This is why we should not simply do or undo things – to observe or abstain – only for the sake of the guideline and timeline we have been given. Instead, we should examine ourselves, and our motivations so that we know exactly what we should be doing at every point in time. If we examine ourselves thoroughly, we will see ourselves clearly. 

Examination involves asking questions not relying on our judgements; we must ask God questions to help us see clearly. The people in the First Reading and the Gospel asked, and they received their answers. In their own mind they were righteous people. In our own minds, also, we are not really bad people. We need God’s standard of judgement if we are to make any progress in our lives – physical or spiritual. 

May we ask. May we receive an answer. May we respond. If today, you hear His voice, harden not your heart. “A heart contrite and humbled, O God, you will not spurn” (Ps 51:19)
