```
Joel 2:12-18
Psalms 51:3-6, 12-14, 17
2 Corinthians 5:20--6:2
Matthew 6:1-6, 16-18
```

God has a time for everything. Now is the time to check whether we have a good heart or whether we need to get a new one. Now is the time to find our what fills our minds all the time and empty it of all that is not God or of God. Now is the time to admit that we have no other recourse but God. Now is the time to cast ourselves on His mercy and beg for forgiveness. 

When we sin, we cannot offer anything to the Lord because we don't have anything pleasing to offer. If we repent, He will provide us with what we can use to offer Him. The only condition for forgiveness is that our repentance is heartfelt; with our whole heart and mind. Beware of having no piety apart from that seen by men. Beware of being only ceremonial without any real faith in God. 

_My transgression, truly, I know them;
My sin is always before me.
Against you, you alone, have I sinned;
what is evil in your sight, I have done._
