When you've been lied to, what do you do? How do you feel? I wonder how our first parents felt; their actions only show how they tried to cover thing up and hide, but not how they felt about being lied to. How did they feel about being caught? What did all this mean to them? It feels like when some things are made clear to us, we don't react appropriately. We just ask ourselves, "where do we go from here?" without reflecting on where we came from and its significance.

It's not always about moving forward, especially if that movement is trying to get us away from the reality that we have made mistakes and errors in judgement. If we feel that forgetting about the past will make us happier and more fulfiled, then we are not making any progress and our movement is only haphazard, leading us nowhere. Dealing with the past is not erasing it from our memory but finding ways in the present to make the choices we should have made in the past; that is the way we make up for the past. 

Jesus had to make up for the errors our parents made in the past, and He had to do it, not once, but three times. All three temptations point to one fact: there is nothing that trumps God. There is nothing that we go through in life that trumps the word of God and once it is the word of God, it must be followed, even to our death. 

I used to think that maybe if God had explained His reasons for the restriction, maybe the devil will have had less chances of deceiving our first parents, or even deceiving us. But it seems that there is no knowledge in the world extensive enough to secure obedience. It is only the resolution one had made in the mind which will be followed, and that resolution will wait for the oportune time to be executed, no matter how long it takes. If we don't really want to obey God, the slightest excuse will be reason enough to disobey because we have always been waiting for an opportunity whether we know it or not. 

It is only when we want God for Himself that the devil will have nothing to tempt us with. The devil is powerless against our resolutions if we have resolved to obey the voice of God no matter what. If we can make up our mind to obey the will of God because it is God's will, then we will have the ability to drive away the devil like a flea, "Begone, Satan!" and he will depart. We only blame him because we don't want to take responsibilities for our decisions. 

Even if we fall into temptation and the devil seems to have won, he hasn't won if we react appropriately!!! We should not just sew leaves to cover our nakedness. We should not look for who to cast the blame on. We should not just move on (we can't even if we try, we just think we are, and that makes us feel comfortable and proactive). We should reflect on the truth we have discovered which is contrary to the lie we have been fed, and understand that nothing we want for ourselves is better than what God wants for us. God loves us more than we love ourselves, and if we can't do anything else to save ourselves from ourselves like making firm resolutions, we can, at least, take the blame for our actions and beg to be restored back to favour.

_My transgressions, truly I know them:  
my sin is always before me.  
Against you, you alone have I sinned;  
what is evil in your sight I have done._
