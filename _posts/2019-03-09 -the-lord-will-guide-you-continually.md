```Is 58:9b-14
Ps 86:1-2, 3-4, 5-6
Lk 5:27-32
```
It is possible that we already have some idea of ourselves. After all, we have been living with ourselves for quite some time now; all our lives in fact. Therefore, looking inward might not be exactly what we want to be doing, now or at any other point in time, because looking inward is gloomy expedition we dread. It might be that we have gotten used to ourselves and/or given up on changing to whatever it is God wants us to be. This is a non-physical form of suicide. We are still living and carrying out our daily tasks, and yet already dead. 

During Lent, we are continually asked to repent – turn away from your sin and live – and it chafes on the nerves and makes us bristle, “Is it that time of the year again?” That could be because we have equated repentance with remorse. Remorse is a feeling which quickly turns to self-disgust and then despair, and then physical or non-physical suicide. Repentance is decisive action towards goodness filled with hope, because God is our guide, specifically as a teacher and a doctor.

In the First Reading which continues from yesterday, even though God has called them out on what they do that displeases Him, He doesn’t leave them to stew in their misery. Obviously, there is some part of them that longs for God, otherwise, why will they question Him in the first place? And God knows this fact, otherwise, why will He answer them? Therefore, even as He tells them what they should and should not do, He gives them hope; He layers each of His instructions with promises which all point to the fact that He will be with them at every step of the way, if only they can make that decisive move towards Him. “…then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.”(Is 58:10)

In the Gospel, Jesus doesn’t use flowery language to convey the same message; He doesn’t use many words at all, He simply says, “Follow me” (Luke 5:27) which roughly translates to “If you will be for me, then I will be with you.” The fact that Levi was a tax collector will follow him all his life - it is still following him, even now, after his death – and yet instead of brooding about it, the man gives a great feast. And Jesus, rather than being repelled, eats and drinks with more tax collectors and sinners. He doesn’t stand afar to call the sinners, He sits among them to call them. He doesn’t ask them for remorse, instead He wants to infuse hope into them.

This decisive move of Levi is captured in the Responsorial Psalm, “Teach me your way, O Lord, that I may walk in your truth.” (Ps 86:11). Rather than remorse, Levi is filled with hope; he doesn’t know exactly how he is going to change, he only knows that if he follows Jesus, he will. Rather than becoming one of the living-dead, Levi’s prayer is, “Keep my life  … save your servant … You are my God.” (Ps 86:2-3)

Jesus is, also, a doctor. To drive home this doctoral qualification of Jesus, the Gospel acclamation says, “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked man, says the Lord, but rather in his conversion, that he may live.” (Ez. 33:11) Is there any doctor that can abide the senseless death of a patient when they can save them? Is there any doctor that can effectively diagnose a patient from a distance? Is there any doctor who will not be interested in the progress and well-being of their patient? Is there any doctor who will not stand by, offering as much of their expertise as possible until the patient completely recovers? 

Remorse can only be turned to contrition which leads to repentance if there is a strong and certain knowledge that we are loved by the one who calls us to repentance. Today’s readings want to convey that love to us. God is not asking us to hang our head in despair, or numb our natural responses to our state of life and seek our own solutions to them, but to look up in hope to Him, who loves us incomprehensibly and unconditionally, and who is at hand to save us – to guide us, to teach us, to doctor us – precisely because we are unrighteous.
