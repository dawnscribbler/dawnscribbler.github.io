[Ash Wednesday](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/daily-readings//2020-02-26)

```
Joel 2:12-18
Psalms 51:3-6, 12-14, 17
2 Corinthians 5:20--6:2
Matthew 6:1-6, 16-18
```

There are two aspects of Lent. There is the Individual aspect and the Group aspect. But I wonder which comes first? The group or the individial? 

If we repent, He will provide us with what we can use to offer Him. His blessing is not for our comfort but to be used for His honour and glory. When we sin, we cannot offer anything to the Lord because we don't have anything to offer. And this is a serious problem whic warrants that everybody needs to be involved in the effort to beg God to forgive us and beg for mercy. 

I think we might have individualised Lent to a great extent. I think it is much more than us as indivduals. It should be a time where we as a Church pray for the whole Church and beg God for blessings - things that will make for acceptable offering to Him. 

Once we have been washed clean, we are clean. In the words of Jesus, "Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean". We have been batised, we are clean, but our feet gets dirty a lot. To wash our feet is to partake in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. On a personal level, many of us are clean-ish. However, like Jesus said, "Not all of you are...". There are some people whose sins cause a lot of problems for us as a Church, and those sins affect us individually. Therefore, individuals must pray as a Church for God to have mercy on us despite the sins of a few of us. 

Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them. Beware of having no piety apart from that seen by men.
