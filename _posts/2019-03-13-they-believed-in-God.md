[Wednesday of the First Week of Lent](https://www.ewtn.com/daily-readings/?date=2019-03-13)

```
Jonah 3:1-10
Ps 51:3-4, 12-13, 18-19
Lk 11:29-32
```
It happens that we desire to feel truly penitent and make reparation for our sins, but we doubt the possibility of ever getting to the “call a fast and put on sackcloth” and sit “in ashes” stage. The readings of today intimate us that it all starts with our heart because this is the incubator of our belief in God. We are called to check whether we really believe in God. 

The most beautiful part of the First Reading, for me, is the sentence, “And the people of Nineveh believed God.” Unlike most of the Prophets who spoke, Jonah didn’t say, “thus says the Lord” or the “mouth of the Lord has spoken”; he simply said, “Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” Why did they believe God when was it Jonah who spoke to them? How did they make the leap from the words of Jonah to repentance?

Unfortunately, the Crowd in the Gospel couldn’t seem to be make the leap from Jesus to God; Jesus spoke but they did not believe in God. Instead, they clamoured for a sign; something to show the origins of His authority for the things He said and did. However, Jesus didn’t come to showcase Himself but to return their hearts back to God. All that He did was to show them that “something greater” was in their midst so as to grab their attention and get them to consider their ways. That “something greater” was far more than the people of Nineveh and Queen Esther got in the persons of Jonah and King Solomon. 

Therefore, they were “an evil generation” as it shouldn’t have been difficult to recognise that “something greater” was in their midst since they were the chosen Nation that already believed in God. And because they couldn’t, this was proof that they had gone astray from God and needed to turn back to Him; for if a Nation that is truly Godless could make a complete U-turn at the words of a mere Prophet, and a Pagan Queen could come halfway around the world because she discerned the endowment of wisdom from on High in the words of an earthly King, what excuse did they have?  

It clearly shows that only hearts that really seek the Lord will find Him. We can say the words with our mouths, but we cannot lie in our hearts. It is possible that the obstacles to the message of repentance is not because we haven’t seen enough or heard enough, but our unwillingness to consider that there are areas our lives that are in error. Either that, or we are simply stalling, delaying, looking for excuses and hoping that, somehow, we can remain as we are and be Godly at the same time. 

The difference between the Ninevites and the Crowd lies in the heart – one was already open to repentance but needed a bit of prodding while the other was comfortable with the status quo and refused to consider the possibility of errors. What makes this difference really huge is that the closed and hardened heart was the one that already professed to believe in God. That is why the Gospel acclamation reads, “Even now, says the Lord, return to me with all your heart.”

Therefore, we have hope, that even if we haven’t gotten to “sackcloth and ashes” with “fasting and weeping”, our willingness to get there is all that is required to get us there. “A broken and humbled heart, O God, you will not spurn”.
