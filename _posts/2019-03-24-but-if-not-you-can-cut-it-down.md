The path we have been taking, so far, during this Lenten journey has been littered with pleas and calls to repentance. It is a fact that we are not total unbelievers. But the truth of the matter is that we do fall, and we fall more often than we think we do. It will not be an exaggeration to say that almost everything we do is tinged with a bit of wrongness; a bit of badness or imperfection. Which is why we need a stark reminder that there is an end to all this pleading and cajoling. Today, we are presented with the consequence of not responding to this call. 

The First Reading presents to us the God WHO IS, who will “come down to deliver” His people out of their distress – the all-powerful and ever-present God who will go to the most extreme lengths for His people. But before rescuing His people, it was necessary to make clear His identity to them because they had been in a land of polytheism for too long. This is what prompted Moses to ask, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?”

It is possible that they still remembered the God of their ancestors, but by the time of Slavery, they might have just put Him on the list of the several gods that were being worshipped. It is possible that Moses, also, needed to be reminded, because he didn’t immediately recognise the workings of God in the miraculous sight he beheld. It was necessary to connect the omnipotent God, “I AM WHO I AM” with the God of their ancestors, “‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you’: this is my name for ever,” so that when the deliverance takes place, there can be no doubt nor excuse not to give Him their fullest loyalty. 

From the Second Reading, we find that the Israelites didn’t always keep faith with God. But what is very interesting is the warning that St. Paul gives, “Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall”, because it seems to imply that the people who did not please God and were overthrown in the wilderness had no idea that there were not pleasing to God. Not that there were not knowledgeable about the Law, not that they were not partakers of the favours and blessings of the Lord, but because, though they confessed with their lips, their hearts were far away from God; they desired evil things and they grumbled against God (1 Cor. 10:6).

Another interesting point about the warning of St. Paul is the part of “…he fall”. It is a very definite point; there is nothing mushy about it. It is a very objective point; there are no qualifiers – it can happen to ANYBODY. Open your heart, search your soul, acknowledge your guilt, turn to the Lord, ask for the grace of steadfastness; take heed else YOU fall.  “Now these things happened to them as a warning, but they were written down for our instruction, upon whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.”

It is probably because it is easy for us to believe we are the righteous ones and everybody else is the sinner that Jesus gives asks these questions in the Gospel, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered thus? …do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem?” My first thought is yes, or else, why they unfortunate? It is also probably why misfortune befalls us, we feel unfortunate and feel like God has abandoned us – we feel like the worst sinners. However, these are warning to us, wake-up calls, given how easy it is for us to fall into complacency, “I tell you, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”

The call to repent doesn’t mean that we are the worst offenders; even the best – the most saint-like human being – is also called to repent. So long as we are alive, we will always be called to repent because we need to make sure that we are bearing fruits – either we have started bearing fruits or, if we had started, are still bearing fruit. “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it…” We are the fig tree in the vineyard of the Lord. He will always come looking for fruit. He will have patience and keep coming. If after a while, there are no fruits, he will cut the fig tree down.  Objectively. Decisively. Dispassionately. 

We have another period of grace; the Gospel Acclamation sounds the hopeful bell, “Repent, says the Lord, for the Kingdom of God is at hand”. We have another “year” to be dug and manured – to be fertilised and cultivated. Let us make the most of it. “The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him.”
