[Monday of the First Week of Lent](https://www.ewtn.com/daily-readings/?date=2019-03-11)

```
Lv. 19:1-2, 11-18
Ps 19:8, 9, 10, 15
Mt 25:31-46
```

A lot of things go through my head when I think of doing things to or for people. My heart and spirit recoils when I think about the nameless and faceless people I am supposed to be doing things for in the name of loving God. Why does loving God have to be so practical? Why can’t I just stay in a nice, quiet bubble and ignore the world? Why do I fret when I find that my fate in eternity is hinged on the words, “as you did it (not) to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it (not) to me”. 

The Gospel theme is very scary; its setting and the finality of the judgement terrify me. It feels like upon hearing the reason for their damnation, the “goats” were scandalised; I can feel their heart beating in dread and self-hatred as they realise that the requirements for salvation was quite easy – something uncomfortable but doable – and they could have done it easily without losing sleep. Even as they question the Son of Man, their minds subconsciously bring up the scenes of missed opportunities and they wince in pain at how a different attitude could have yielded a different outcome. It is possible that they are wishing to get one more chance to make things right. 

It is easy to imagine that if they did have one more chance, they will put all their energy into loving their neighbour and will do a better job than the “sheep” ever did in their own lifetime. But the more I think about it, the more I don’t think so. I believe that if these same “goats” had a second chance, they will not do better than previously because the fog which clouded their judgement in the first place hasn’t been dispelled. Which is why we don’t get second chances. We only have one chance – one life – and whatever we make of it is what determines our end. And so the Gospel Acclamations warns us, “Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” (2 Cor. 6:2b) Now. Now. NOW. We have to work to dispel the fog NOW. 

The First Reading very interesting because, although it should be a long and boring list of dos and don’ts, it is interspersed with the sentence, “I am the Lord”. This is interesting because I was sure there was another importance to that line apart from just breaking the monotony of the list. And then I noticed something else, if we read the whole passage of Leviticus 19, twice before the sentence, “I am the Lord”, is another, “…fear your God”, 

A lot of things we are to do or not to do not because of how we feel about them, but because we have in our consciousness someone far greater than we are. It’s like God already knows that there are a lot of things that will not come as naturally to us as eating and breathing, and we will need something to bolster our courage and uncoil the heart and spirit from the natural dread of leaving our comfort zone to take up the challenge of loving God. Practically. The way He should be loved. And so He leaves us with the words, “I am the Lord”. 

It is possible He means us to turn them into a mantra that we use to quell any rising bile and panic and instil peace and calm. Because the words of the Responsorial Psalm certainly have that point us to that way of thinking, “The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; … the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; the ordinances of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether … O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.” (Ps. 19:7, 9, 14) This assurance is meant to calm us down, and keep us sharp also, so that we can do whatever needs to be done. 

Therefore, rather than hoping for second chances or hoping that God will go lenient with us because of our shortcomings and limitations, let us work to dispel the fog that blocks our mind to the realities of our responsibilities to God. Even when fear pierces through, the fog still comes back to make us relax.  Let us fervently pray to become “sheep” so to “inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (Matt. 25:34). Let us be the ones questioning God in pleasant surprise and gladness rather in guilty dread and desolation. “Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.” (Ps. 19:14)
