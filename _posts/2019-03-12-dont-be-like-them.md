[Tuesday of the First Week of Lent](https://www.ewtn.com/daily-readings/?date=2019-03-12)

```
Is 55:10-11
PS 34:4-5, 6-7, 16-17, 18-19
Mt 6:7-15
```
It is entirely mortifying to be speaking to someone and they tell you, “You talk too much.” Again, it can be demoralizing if they always punctuate a conversation with, “I know. You are not telling me anything new.” This two situations stifles communication because one will struggle to find what to say to another. And since it is proven knowledge that without communication, a relationship cannot thrive, we are called to ponder on whether we really have a relationship with God in the first place.  

The warning about “empty phrases” has nothing to do with the length of our prayer. In fact, the longer we spend in prayer, the better because it usually points to a deepening love and dependence on God. The emptiness being referred to is the lack of trust in God and a preoccupation with self. The only way to know if we are really in a relationship is if trust exists and we are more preoccupied with the needs of the other party. “… Don’t be like them.” Don’t be like those people who imagine that they are in a relationship when they are not. 

“Your Father already knows your needs before you ask” is a calm assurance that we are already under God’s favour and need not fear.  Therefore, we can afford to expand our horizons and pray for things - preoccupy ourselves with things - concerning God and concerning neighbour. This is further emphasised by the Gospel Acclamation, “Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God”. Which is why the Lord's Prayer highlights the important things we need to pray for; the reign of God in the world and the mercy and protection of God in our lives which automatically extends to our neighbour. 

But how do we get to the point of trusting God? Two ways: look to the word of God, and listen to the testimony of those who have taken the leap of faith. The First Reading tells us that as trustworthy as the rain is in providing raw materials and ensuring end products, so also is the word of God, which not only accomplishes its task, but prospers it also! The Responsorial Psalm is the testimony of one who put his trust in the Lord and was rewarded. And now, he encourages us to, "Look towards Him and be radiant and let not your faces be abashed" for the simple reason that, "this lowly one called and the Lord heard him, and rescued him from all his distress.” 

A lot of rules and guidelines have been proposed to us; some prayers have been promoted as the most efficacious. We must never forget that the effectiveness of those prayers depend on the vessel from which they emanate from. The one who has more faith will be granted more; the one with the most love and child-like trust even more than the one with faith. There are no perfect words, only a perfect disposition – both interior and exterior, and we must allow the word of God to take root in our heart for us to get to that point.
