[Monday of the Second Week of Lent](https://www.ewtn.com/daily-readings/?date=2019-03-18)

```
Dan. 9: 4-10
Ps 79: 8, 9, 11, 13 (R. Ps 103:10)
Lk 6:36-38 
```

When an injury has been committed, there are always only two sides; the side to which belongs righteousness and the side to which belongs confusion of face. When we admit our guilt, we are automatically choosing the side to which belongs confusion of face because there is nothing we can say or do to excuse ourselves, “we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and ordinances, we have not listened…” Therefore, we understand that we are at the mercy of the one to whom righteousness belongs and that the one to whom righteousness belongs has all the power to recommend the measure of justice they feel will satisfy the injury. 

For the sins we have committed against God, knowingly or unknowingly, we deserve whatever punishment He decides to inflict on us and we can only beg Him to have mercy on us for no other reason than for His name’s sake. “Do not remember against us the guilt of former times… Free us and forgive us our sins, because of your name”. We really have nothing else to use to plead our case with God; we need come to that reality of how wretched we are before God and beg for His compassion “Let your compassion hasten to meet us; for we have been brought very low” or we die in our sins. 

Our sins majorly consist of rebelling against the words of God, “we have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name…and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by following His laws”. It is always our word against God’s word; we like our own words better. When we admit our guilt and beg God for compassion, then we echo the words of the Gospel Acclamation, “Your words, Lord are Spirit and Life; you have the words of eternal life.” At this point, we agree that it is better to listen to God and follow His directives. This is what our repentance and conversion consist of.

There is a very heady feeling about being in power, and the power that comes from being the injured party is naturally very intoxicating; naturally we want to stew in the feeling of being wronged for a long as possible; dissecting and analysing the situation. But there is something headier than this, and that is the power to forgive. Whenever we attempt to “Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful”, we become like God. The word to note in this line is the “even” which tells us that God’s mercy is so boundless that we can only hope to imitate even little bit of it. This, however, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.

Without the assurance of God’s mercy and compassion, we are lost. There is great shame in finding out and dealing with guilt and it can keep us looped in a never-ending replay of our past sins and mistakes. God, on His part, does not judge us, neither does He condemn us, but He forgives us. Therefore, when someone else is lost because we are the ones to whom belongs righteousness, then the remembrance of our lost state with regards to God, and the mercy we are receiving from Him, should spur us on to, also, be compassionate to others. 

I conjecture that we can come to the full knowledge of God’s mercy by attempting to practice it ourselves. If this is so, then that feeling of forgiveness; that feeling of being forgiven after admission of guilt is probably the “…good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be put in your lap.” As boundless as the mercy of God is, it seems we cannot experience it in its entirety unless we attempt to do the same to others because, “For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.”
