There are many differences between us and God apart from the obvious fact that He is God and we are not. And yet, even this obvious difference is not the most outstanding. The most outstanding difference is His ability to forgive. I want to claim not to understand this concept – I want to claim that it is above my capacity to comprehend – but the more I think about it, the more I understand that it is easy, and almost effortless, to forgive somebody if they are totally certain that they won’t offend you again provided you were already looking out for a way to forgive them in the first place. 

That God is looking out for a way to forgive us is evident in all our Readings of today. This is why the nature of God is Love. This is why the total remission of our sins is possible. In the First Reading, we are told, “He does not retain his anger for ever because he delights in steadfast love (mercy).” In the Responsorial Psalm, we are told, “For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his steadfast love (so strong His mercy) toward those who fear him”. And then in the Gospel, we hear, “But while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.” It is almost like without asking, we are already guaranteed forgiveness. 

This free gift of mercy seems too wonderful to be a fact, and we begin to fear that it is possible to be misused or taken for granted. It can’t be. Because for us to merit this total and unconditional forgiveness, we must be ready to do a total about-turn in our way of living which starts with acknowledgment of our guilt – the harm we have done to ourselves, the grievance against our neighbour and the grievance against  God. “How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, but I perish here with hunger (harm done to himself)! I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven (grievance against God) and before you (grievance against our neighbour)”.

It is by such humility – acknowledging our guilt – that the father was able to raise the prodigal son to a status even higher than he previously was. “Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring the fatted calf and kill it...” Before we sinned, we were normal sons. After we sinned and while we remain in sin, we become prodigal sons. When we recover our senses FULLY and turn back to God WHOLEHEARTEDLY, we become more than sons.

The fear of this mercy of God, or the reluctance to turn to Him is because we do not totally hate all our sins. There are things that we fear to give up because it seems impossible to be able to live without them. Other things, we fear to give up, because we are waiting to gain control over ourselves before turning to God; we are not entirely sure we can give them up, and so we try to change by our own effort. But if we try for too long without success, then despair sets in and we are back at square one. 

It seems that the most efficient way to start the process of acknowledging our guilt is to ponder in the same way the prodigal son pondered and recollect on the times when we caught a glimpse of God’s mercy or favour, and ask ourselves, ‘if the Lord did this to me without me being as holy as I should, what do I really have to lose if I give myself wholeheartedly?’ This thinking also carries through from the First Reading, “let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old”. Thinking about times past, in this manner, will give us the strength to move forward in our journey of reconciliation with God. “Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all within me, his holy name! Bless the LORD, O my soul, and never forget all his benefits”
