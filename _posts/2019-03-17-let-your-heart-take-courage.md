I find it interesting that both the First Reading and the Gospel share several similar events – sleep, fear, glory of the Lord, and the voice of God – but what ties all three Readings together is the message of patient and steadfast hope. 

In the First Reading, Abram waited the whole day, and had to battle with depression and uncertainty, “when birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away”. But as the sun went down, so did his hope in the Lord, “a deep sleep fell on Abram; and lo, a dread and great darkness fell upon him”. And yet, the Lord waited until it was totally dark – the hope totally gone – before He manifested Himself. 

In the Second Reading, the “enemies of the cross of Christ” are those who had given up hope on the coming of the Saviour, and had turned back to their former ways. The issue is not so much that they had returned to former ways, but that they still wanted to be associated with the body of the Church. This causes problems because new entrants and people with weak faith will be easily carried away by wolves in sheep clothing. St Paul, therefore admonishes us, “mark those who so live as you have an example in us”. 

In the Gospel, Jesus took three of His disciples up to the mountain to pray. It is possible that Jesus had told them the reason for His prayer; that He wanted more clarification and insight into “His departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem”. They would have been excited at the onset, but as the time ticked by, that enthusiasm would have faded and so, they became “heavy with sleep”, and almost missed the best part. That it was the best part is clear from Peter’s words that he didn’t want the experience to end. And yet the better than the best part was still to come; the overshadowing of the cloud and the voice of God.  

“…when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone.” I feel quite certain that this will have been the same experience for Abraham. After the voice of the Lord pronounced the covenant with Abram, Abram will have also been found to be alone. It feels melancholy; to be found alone after such a powerful experience of the presence of God. And yet we see that both in both cases, this experience must have been the major determinant in keeping their faith firmly fixed on God; never once do we see them waver.

Because alone, Abram left everything he knew and loved and move to unknown and unexplored territory. Even with that aloneness, Abram remained solidly faithful to the Lord throughout his life. He still had a lot to go through – even his name still needed to be changed – and he didn’t waver from his faithfulness with God.  And this was the same with Jesus. Alone, Jesus had to face his Passion and death. And once his hour had come, not once did he waver from the path; instead he seemed to urge it on with carefully planned intermittent silences and speeches. Because He was alone, He was able to always direct his tears and supplications to the right source; He was able to always remain connected with God. 

When the voice told the disciples, “This is my Son, my Chosen, listen to Him!” it sort of meant “Wait for the LORD with courage; be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD”, because Jesus still had many more things to tell them, but which didn’t make sense until after His death and resurrection, and still much more which had to wait until the coming of the Holy Spirit, but they had to be listen and wait with courage. Their own moment of manifestation was the Resurrection of Jesus, and after the Ascension of Jesus, then the disciples were found alone. And in their own aloneness, they never wavered from their faith in Christ even in death.

It is terrifying to be in the midst of “enemies of the cross of Christ” and even when one knows one is in the right, an overwhelming number against one is…overwhelming. And yet, one must not lose fear or lose hope. “The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?” When things need clarification, we can go up to the mountain to pray like Jesus, we can ask like Abram, “how am I to know that I shall possess it?” or we can pray like the Psalmist, “O Lord, hear my voice when I call, have mercy and answer me. Of you my heart has spoken, ‘Seek His face.’ It is your face, O Lord, that I seek; hide not your face from me.” And when we hear the voice in the cloud that says, “Wait for the LORD with courage; be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD”, then we will be found alone, but alone with God, and with the strength to … “stand firm thus in the Lord” and conquer.
