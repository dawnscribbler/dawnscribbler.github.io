```
Lv. 19:1-2, 11-18
Ps 19:8, 9, 10, 15
Mt 25:31-46
```

Righteousness. To be holy is part of righteousness. To love our neighbour is makes us holy because it makes us like God, who is holy.

We were told to do things in imitation of God. Now, we are told to do things because it is God we are actually doing them too; extra motivation to do things, because if we love God, we won't hesitate to do things for God, even if His face is different every time.

Jesus has so interwoven the love we owe God and neighbor that it is inseparable. It almost diminishes the love we are supposed to have for God. God is seemingly no longer placed on a pedestal but is intertwined with common man. 

Is it any wonder the Pharisees rejected such a God? Why will anyone belittle themselves when everyone is looking for a way to elevate themselves and to become someone or something? Associating with common man is belittling.

And yet that is the command of the Lord; that is the word of the Lord which is spirit and life.
