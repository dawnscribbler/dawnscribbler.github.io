<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'><span style='font-size:
18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>17/01/2019</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>Dear Mr Philip, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>You might be wondering what is so
special about Sunday Mass since it seems like just another day of the week. But
I want to give you three reasons why it is special, and why the impact it has
on your identity as a Christian. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>Before I give the three reasons,
I, first of all, want to point out and correct a misconception that we all
have. People say that Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday. Because of
this way of thinking, people believe that the only reason to come for Sunday Mass
is to mark the day of rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>Sunday is not the Sabbath.
Sabbath is the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the week which is Saturday. Sunday is the
1<sup>st</sup> day of the week. But the greatness of what we celebrate on
Sunday far outweighs the day of rest that out of reverence and in thanksgiving
to God, we rest on Sunday also. So, it is not obligatory to rest on Saturday,
but Sunday. However, it doesn’t have to be an obligation if we really
understand what we celebrate on Sunday. We Christians, Catholics in particular,
mark it for three reasons: It is the day of Light, Life and Grace. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>Day of Light:</span></u><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'> The
first day of the week is the day God created Light. <i>“</i></span><i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Colonna MT"'>And God
said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was Light… And there was evening, and
there was morning—the first day”</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Colonna MT"'> </span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>Have you ever wondered what this
Light is? Because even after creating the Light and separating it from
darkness, and calling them day and night, you will realise that without the
sun, we cannot see. So why did He use a whole day to create “Light” and then another
day (the fourth day!) to create the Heavenly bodies? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>It is because this Light is the
Light of Christ, the Light is Christ, and which He brought at His coming in the
flesh. It is the light Christ refers to when He says, </span><i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Colonna MT"'>“I am the <u>light</u>
of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in <u>darkness</u> but will have
the light of life.” (John 8:12). </span></i><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'> Or again, at Christmas, when we
read from Isaiah, </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Colonna MT"'>“The people who walked in <u>darkness</u> have seen a
great <u>light</u>; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has
light shone” (Isaiah 9:2). </span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:
107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>This Light refers to two things:
understanding and goodness. When we have this light, we will be able to
understand the things of God and become truly good people of God. This is the
light of life. We must have this Light to live properly in this life and to
have any hope of life in eternity. Without this Light, we cannot see God. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>So when we come to Church to mark
the day of Light, we give thanks to God for giving us this Light; the ability
to understand His ways and to walk in His path. Alternatively, we also come to
ask for more Light and/or to admit to God how we have not always walked in His
Light and ask for strength to start or continue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>Day of Life</span></u><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>: The
first day of the week is the day Jesus rose from the dead. </span><i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Colonna MT"'>“Now on the
first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb
bringing the spices which they had prepared… and behold, two men stood by them
in shining garments… said to them, ‘Why do you seek the living among the dead?
He is not here, but is risen!’ ” (Luke 24: 1-6). </span></i><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'> This is
the Chief reason among all the other reasons why we gather on Sunday; this is
the foundation of our Faith. If Christ hadn’t risen from the dead, then
everything He said from the beginning of His ministry is a lie. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>To rise from the dead <b><u>by
one’s own power</u></b> is a very <b><i>very</i></b> great achievement; so
great, that only God can do it. Normally, we hear that someone else raised
another person from the dead, and we marvel and say, that person who prayed has
great faith in God. But imagine a dead person standing up without anybody
praying or anything like that. The dead person woke up and stood up and came
with His solid body through a closed door and showed you evidence that He is
still a normal human being even though He can move like air. Wow! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>On Sunday, this is what we
celebrate: this “wow!” We celebrate the victory of life over death. We have
proof that even if we die a physical death, there is still life that is more
than this life. We will still have our solid bodies, but we will be as fluid as
air. We give thanks to God that because He died and rose, we also, if we
believe in Him, will also share in this wonderful life. Wow!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>Day of Grace:</span></u><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'> The
first day of the week is the day the Holy Spirit first came down on the
Apostles. </span><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Colonna MT"'>“When the day of Pentecost came, they… saw what seemed to be
tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them
were filled with the Holy Spirit...” (Acts 2:1-4). </span></i><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'> Now this
is a very interesting feast because its significance is not very
straightforward and requires a bit of history. </span></p>

  created the <i>ekklesia</i>, the called out body of Christ, the church. These
  fulfilments were obviously no coincidence, but were part of the overall plan
  and purpose of God in verifying the powerful meaning of the death and
  resurrection of Christ, and the establishment of the new body of believers. </span></p>

the birthday of the Church, because without Pentecost, we will never have heard

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>And this is the Grace that God
has granted to us: that by being in fellowship with the Apostles, who were in
fellowship with Christ, we might also be in fellowship with Christ. And since
Christ is in fellowship with the Father, then we are also in fellowship with
the God. It’s like a chain or a rope that God is holding out to us, and we need
to decide if we will hold on to it or ignore it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Buxton Sketch"'>I am extremely glad that you come
for weekday Masses already. I think it will take a lot more effort to convince
anyone to come for weekday Mass. But coming on weekdays without the knowledge
of why Sunday is even more important is like building a house without a solid
foundation. Believing in God is hard work. Applying this belief in our everyday
life is even harder. We need every help we can get from God. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;

days to come to Church. Even if you don’t understand now, you will understand
later. For now, just believe that Sunday is greater and make effort to come. If
you are faithful to God, God will also be faithful to you. If it is your Sunday
Business, don’t worry, just tell God, “see my sacrifice for you, and have
mercy”. If you don’t like how Mass is long and boring and crowded, don’t worry,
just tell God, “see my sacrifice for you, and have mercy”. </span></p>
