<p>Dear Mr Philip,</p>
<p>You might be wondering what is so special about Sunday Mass since it seems like just another day of the week. But I want to give you three reasons why it is special, and why the impact it has on your identity as a Christian.</p>
<p>Before I give the three reasons, I, first of all, want to point out and correct a misconception that we all have. People say that Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday. Because of this way of thinking, people believe that the only reason to come for Sunday Mass is to mark the day of rest.</p>
<p>Sunday is not the Sabbath. Sabbath is the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the week which is Saturday. Sunday is the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the week. But the greatness of what we celebrate on Sunday far outweighs the day of rest that out of reverence and in thanksgiving to God, we rest on Sunday also. So, it is not obligatory to rest on Saturday, but Sunday. However, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be an obligation if we really understand what we celebrate on Sunday. We Christians, Catholics in particular, mark it for three reasons: It is the day of Light, Life and Grace.</p>
<p><u>Day of Light:</u> The first day of the week is the day God created Light. <em>&ldquo;</em><em>And God said, &lsquo;Let there be light,&rsquo; and there was Light&hellip; And there was evening, and there was morning&mdash;the first day&rdquo;</em> Have you ever wondered what this Light is? Because even after creating the Light and separating it from darkness, and calling them day and night, you will realise that without the sun, we cannot see. So why did He use a whole day to create &ldquo;Light&rdquo; and then another day (the fourth day!) to create the Heavenly bodies?</p>
<p>It is because this Light is the Light of Christ, the Light is Christ, and which He brought at His coming in the flesh. It is the light Christ refers to when He says, <em>&ldquo;I am the <u>light</u> of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in <u>darkness</u> but will have the light of life.&rdquo; (John 8:12). </em>&nbsp;Or again, at Christmas, when we read from Isaiah, &ldquo;The people who walked in <u>darkness</u> have seen a great <u>light</u>; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone&rdquo; (Isaiah 9:2). This Light refers to two things: understanding and goodness. When we have this light, we will be able to understand the things of God and become truly good people of God. This is the light of life. We must have this Light to live properly in this life and to have any hope of life in eternity. Without this Light, we cannot see God.</p>
<p>So when we come to Church to mark the day of Light, we give thanks to God for giving us this Light; the ability to understand His ways and to walk in His path. Alternatively, we also come to ask for more Light and/or to admit to God how we have not always walked in His Light and ask for strength to start or continue.</p>
<p><u>Day of Life</u>: The first day of the week is the day Jesus rose from the dead. <em>&ldquo;Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared&hellip; and behold, two men stood by them in shining garments&hellip; said to them, &lsquo;Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen!&rsquo; &rdquo; (Luke 24: 1-6). </em>&nbsp;This is the Chief reason among all the other reasons why we gather on Sunday; this is the foundation of our Faith. If Christ hadn&rsquo;t risen from the dead, then everything He said from the beginning of His ministry is a lie.</p>
<p>To rise from the dead <strong><u>by one&rsquo;s own power</u></strong> is a very <strong><em>very</em></strong> great achievement; so great, that only God can do it. Normally, we hear that someone else raised another person from the dead, and we marvel and say, that person who prayed has great faith in God. But imagine a dead person standing up without anybody praying or anything like that. The dead person woke up and stood up and came with His solid body through a closed door and showed you evidence that He is still a normal human being even though He can move like air. Wow!</p>
<p>On Sunday, this is what we celebrate: this &ldquo;wow!&rdquo; We celebrate the victory of life over death. We have proof that even if we die a physical death, there is still life that is more than this life. We will still have our solid bodies, but we will be as fluid as air. We give thanks to God that because He died and rose, we also, if we believe in Him, will also share in this wonderful life. Wow!</p>
<p><u>Day of Grace:</u> The first day of the week is the day the Holy Spirit first came down on the Apostles. <em>&ldquo;When the day of Pentecost came, they&hellip; saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit...&rdquo; (Acts 2:1-4). </em>&nbsp;Now this is a very interesting feast because its significance is not very straightforward and requires a bit of history.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pentecost means fifty, and is actually fifty days from another feast, First Fruits.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These calculations are explained in Leviticus 23:10&ndash;11, 15&ndash;17. The feast of First Fruits was to occur on the day after the Sabbath (verse 11), which was always the <u>Sunday of Passover week</u>.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pentecost, then, was the day after the seventh following Sabbath (verses 15&ndash;16), which would be the fiftieth day after First Fruits and also on a <u>Sunday</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fulfilment of these feasts is striking:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus died the Friday of Passover week and had to be buried hastily before sunset, which was when the Sabbath began.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His body remained in the borrowed sepulchre throughout the Sabbath day,</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but on that Sunday morning, when the priest was to offer the First Fruits offering in the Temple, Christ arose from the dead, the first fruits of them that slept (I Cor. 15:20).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For forty ensuing days, the Lord appeared to His disciples in His resurrection body, and then ascended into Heaven. Ten days later, the Sunday of the Feast of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended upon the believers in Jerusalem and created the <em>ekklesia</em>, the called out body of Christ, the church. These fulfilments were obviously no coincidence, but were part of the overall plan and purpose of God in verifying the powerful meaning of the death and resurrection of Christ, and the establishment of the new body of believers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, on Sunday, we celebrate the birthday of the Church, because without Pentecost, we will never have heard the word of God. We will still be people without any hope of light. Because apart from Christ, who is the <u>Light</u>, and who died to give us <u>Life</u>, we &ldquo;&hellip;can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15: 5).</p>
<p>And this is the Grace that God has granted to us: that by being in fellowship with the Apostles, who were in fellowship with Christ, we might also be in fellowship with Christ. And since Christ is in fellowship with the Father, then we are also in fellowship with the God. It&rsquo;s like a chain or a rope that God is holding out to us, and we need to decide if we will hold on to it or ignore it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am extremely glad that you come for weekday Masses already. I think it will take a lot more effort to convince anyone to come for weekday Mass. But coming on weekdays without the knowledge of why Sunday is even more important is like building a house without a solid foundation. Believing in God is hard work. Applying this belief in our everyday life is even harder. We need every help we can get from God.</p>
<p>Please, also add Sunday to your days to come to Church. Even if you don&rsquo;t understand now, you will understand later. For now, just believe that Sunday is greater and make effort to come. If you are faithful to God, God will also be faithful to you. If it is your Sunday Business, don&rsquo;t worry, just tell God, &ldquo;see my sacrifice for you, and have mercy&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t like how Mass is long and boring and crowded, don&rsquo;t worry, just tell God, &ldquo;see my sacrifice for you, and have mercy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I can talk about this from now till eternity, but I will stop for now. I hope you read it to the end, and I pray that God will continue to guide your feet as He is already doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours in Christ,</p>
