<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>When I decided to put in some decent effort to find God &ndash; the decent effort being following nagging thoughts and impulses &ndash; I asked God for His Light to show me the path I should walk. The first thing I saw was Light. The next thing I saw was darkness. The Light is of God. The darkness is all mine; the desires I didn&rsquo;t realise were hidden, the abundance of things that have to be purged and the transformation that needs to be wrought in me. I realised I needed to change the core of my existence.</p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>My most persistent fear of finding God has always been what He will make me do. I feared that He will compel me to do something against my will, and I will have no choice but&hellip; to run away. In summary, I was afraid to be with Him and I was afraid to be without Him, and yet if He did come to me like I asked, I was sure I will run away. Even if I didn&rsquo;t run immediately, I would run eventually. And that will be an even dismal prospect for me.</p>
<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>For some reason, I felt that God was going to send me somewhere like a missionary. And this is bad because I felt that missionaries were unfortunate people as there was no way anyone would choose to do that willingly. Even if I did manage to be one, I felt, one day, whatever bonds were holding me would snap and I would run away. I asked for His Light, waiting in terror, for God to reveal the uncomfortable location He was going to make me go to; gearing myself to go somewhere. For now, though, it seems that the place I am being sent to &ndash; the place I have to go to &ndash; is into myself.</p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The first thing I realised is that I don&rsquo;t really want to need God or to depend on Him. I want to be good all by myself and I only want the rewards that come from being good; I want to get something good for every good thing that I can accomplish. By myself. However, God is calling me to absolute <a href = "https://soulatcrossroad.com/blog/trust/"> trust<a> &ndash; like a new-born baby depends on his mother for everything from clearing blocked nose to clogged bowels; utter helplessness. This is very hard and totally at odds with the world filled with self-help books and DIY. This is very hard for me who craves independence and self-sufficiency. Already, it seems that God is asking a lot from me and I don&rsquo;t think I can.</p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Apart from working on my dependency status, I find that I have to change my idea of perfection. Or rather, I should say, I have to change from being a perfectionist to one seeking perfection. The effect of the Light is to see myself as I really am, see God as He really is, and understand the distance between us due to our natures and the closeness He wants because of His love for me. To be perfect means to accept all these facts and make an appropriate response towards Him.</p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Looking at the feature picture for this post, the surroundings appear dark despite the sun&rsquo;s brilliance. This is because the camera&rsquo;s focus was on the sun. If, however, I focused on a tree or a building with or without the sun being in the picture, and you would have seen the day as brightly as I saw it. This is the effect of the Light of God; if I look at myself without the Light, there is nothing wrong with me. However, if I focus on the Sun, I see how nothing is right with me.</p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>One needs courage to see oneself as one really is; it is not an endeavour to undertake apart from God, while away from His presence, because one might go mental, and/or kill oneself. On the spiritual journey, this self-knowledge is not shown all at once, it comes in piecemeal; the more I persist, the more I know. But it gets increasingly difficult to hang on to this Light, because when I feel that I should get better at being good, I kept seeing worse things. When am I going to get perfect?! Suffice to say my ego is getting a good bruising. Until I learn humility. Until I learn obedience.</p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There was on saint whose story made me laugh uproariously. He finally found out how much of a sinner he was (maybe He asked for Light also?) and felt a need to do penance for the rest of his life. So, he wore heavy chains and stayed on the outskirts of the city in caves. His city was invaded by soldiers, and two of these soldiers came scouring the caves looking for runaways. Upon finding him, they decided he was a dangerous criminal because of the heavy chains he was wearing. When they approached him and asked him to confirm his status, he said he was the worst offender. Upon confirming their suspicions, one of the soldiers raised his sword to strike him down. Unfortunately for that soldier, his hand remained stuck in the air unable to move. The second soldier then knelt at the feet of the saint and begged him to pray for the other soldier. The Saint prayed, the soldier&rsquo;s hand came down, and both soldiers became converts. I was tickled by the &ldquo;worst offender&rdquo; part; how he felt so penitent that he purposely took the question literally and how the soldiers had no idea that he was talking of something else. I'm not so tickled anymore. The joke is on me now.</p>
