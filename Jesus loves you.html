<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Black",sans-serif'>Jesus</span></b><b><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Annabel 1"'> Loves </span></b><b><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Black",sans-serif'>You</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>I was in a shop one
Sunday and the attendants were talking among themselves in Zulu. Given that I don’t
speak, Zulu, I wouldn’t have bothered trying to sift out the topic of their
discussion. However, they began to say something about <i>“Jesus loves you.
Jesus loves you,”</i> and I got curious. From what I could understand, a group
of Church people had been trying to preach to the man with the phrase <i>“Jesus
loves you”</i>, but apparently, it didn’t mean anything in his day to day life.
And so, he was trying to report the incident to his co-workers, and from the
tone of their replies, it seemed they agreed with him because they were also repeating
<i>“Jesus loves you. Jesus loves you,” </i>with a sneer in their conversation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>There was a time
that sentence didn’t make sense to me. Yes, I was born Christian; Catholic, but
there are so many layers to faith that I didn’t bother trying to start from the
basic layer which is that <i>“God is love”</i>. I never asked myself what it
should mean to me. Recently, though, I’ve begun to ask myself many questions; any
sentence or phrase that I used to take for granted before cannot escape my
microscope now. But why do I feel the need to tell you about myself? It is
because we are also Church People, and we come with the message that, <i>“Jesus
loves you”</i>. And the question you might, or should, ask is what does this
mean to you. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>In my faith journey,
I came across a piece of truth: <i>“If God, then man cannot do as He pleases”</i>.
It was from an article talking about the debate among men about the existence
of God and why people choose to deny or ignore His existence. And the simple
answer is as given above. If we are to acknowledge that there is a God, then we
are not “free”.  Unfortunately, whether we acknowledge it or not, there is a
God, and we are not free. Therefore, whether we are in here or out there, we
are all prisoners. Whether we live in a big mansion or in the gutters, or
whether we are on the right side or wrong side of the law, we are all prisoners.
In short, the earth; <i>life</i> is a very vast prison. And this is where <i>“Jesus
loves you”</i> becomes a lifesaver. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>There is nothing
worse than being under constant vigilance; checking whether you are keeping
this rule or that rule and having to curb your natural instincts and
tendencies. The life of one who acknowledges God is the life of one of life
imprisonment without parole and under the constant threat of sudden death; being
a Christian, the real kind, can get you killed. Therefore, if I am told that
this Jailer <i>is</i> Love, wouldn’t that bring relief to my mind? If the
purpose of this jail, and suffering all these restrictions, is to bring me to a
better place than what I have in this life, then wouldn’t it be better if I lift
my mind away from my current situation in this life and listen to this Jailer who
speaks of love, justice and righteousness to any and every one regardless of
who or what I am. If even to the plants, insects and animals, He is love, how
much more man?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>The next question
becomes, <i>“Can this Jesus love, </i><b>love</b><i>, even </i>me<i>?”</i> This
is the hardest part of all. Because if one can get over this hurdle, the race
to heaven is already half run. This is the point that many people, even seasoned
Christians, haven’t really conquered and why people, initially, get excited
with the idea of God and fall away later or become lukewarm because of one
reason or the other. This was the point that convinced me to try to give my
faith another chance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>I am not exactly a
success in life; the way the world defines success. I am a failure. And it
seems no matter how hard I try, success doesn’t still seem to be in the future.
So to believe that God loves me. Me? Me, who is ashamed to let the world know
how pathetic I am for fear of rejection, God loves <i>me</i>? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>The unequivocal
answer is, “Yes!” He loves you <b>especially</b> as you feel useless and
hopeless. And you might think to yourself that this is pity. But no, this is
compassion. He knows exactly what we are. He has felt exactly what we feel. He
was treated as the worst criminal even when it was obvious to the whole world
that He was innocent. He endured betrayal, rejection, unfair trial, whips, spit,
knocks, thorns and kicks which left Him so disfigured that He was
unrecognizable. His bones were showing even while He was alive and carrying His
Cross. And finally, He was nailed to a wood and left to hang for at least three
hours; hanging on nails in his hands and legs. This man, who is also God, who
is our jailer, also suffered at the hands of cruel men, and He tell you He
loves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>I do not ask you to
believe that He suffered this agony for you. I don’t even ask for immediate
belief in anything I say at this point in time. I only ask you to <i>understand</i>
that this person who is calling out to you in love understands EXACTLY what you
are going through. He suffered the same and more. If an ex-convict tells you<i>,
“I love you”</i> and if I tell you the same, who are you going to believe? The
person who has gone through the same situation as you or the person who is on
the outside looking in? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>I can stand here
and tell you I love you, and I sympathise with you. I can tell you I sort of
understand what you are going through. But the truth is I only understand is
that God loves me. And because He loves me, I understand that He loves you. Regardless
of what we have done privately or publicly. And I understand that if you
understand this, then your life will radically change because no matter the
suffering that you are currently experiencing or will experience in the future,
you will have peace. Not the kind of free-from-worry peace, but the kind of
what-is-this-life peace. It will not be a bump-free ride, but there will be
shock-absorbers; life, even in here, will begin to have meaning and purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>Therefore, if you
want to come to this conviction, then first understand the life of the one who
suffered excruciating pain because He was being obedient to death and ask Him
to help you to understand what you need to do. Say to Him, <i>“Jesus, you love
me. What am I to do?”</i> Because He is alive and kicking, even though you can’t
see Him, you must talk to Him. Because this is a personal love, you must talk
to Him personally. If He is dead, then we are mad people talking to ourselves. Ask
Him constantly. Ask Him sincerely. Ask. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",sans-serif'>Jesus loves you. He
wants you to keep this in mind. No matter what you are going through – no
matter how inhumanely you are treated – He has endured it. And He wants to
console you. But you must bear in mind that this is simply a change of jailer. You
are moving from being controlled by an earthly jailer to a heavenly Jailer. There
are still rules to keep and things to be mindful of. The only difference is
this: Love.  </span></p>
